<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable anesthesia video laryngoscope market consists of two primary types: channelled and un-channelled video laryngoscopes. Channelled video laryngoscopes feature a dedicated channel for guiding endotracheal tubes, facilitating easier intubation and increased control during the procedure. In contrast, un-channelled video laryngoscopes lack this dedicated pathway, relying on visualization alone for intubation. Both types enhance airway management, reduce cross-contamination risks, and improve patient safety, making them vital tools in modern anesthesia practices.</p></p>
