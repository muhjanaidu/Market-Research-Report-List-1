<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Cooling Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Cooling</li><li>Indirect Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Cooling Plants are essential for managing emissions from combustion processes. In the direct cooling method, flue gases are directly contacted with cooling water, effectively reducing temperatures and particulate matter. This method is efficient but may lead to water contamination. In contrast, indirect cooling involves using a heat exchanger, where flue gases transfer heat to a secondary cooling medium without direct contact. While this method minimizes contamination risks, it can be less efficient and more costly. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing environmental compliance and energy recovery.</p></p>
