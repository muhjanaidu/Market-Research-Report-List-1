<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Body Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-Ray Scanner</li><li>Millimeter Wave Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The full body scanner market primarily consists of two types: X-ray scanners and millimeter wave scanners. X-ray scanners utilize ionizing radiation to penetrate clothing and generate images of concealed items, offering high-resolution output but raising concerns about exposure risks. In contrast, millimeter wave scanners use non-ionizing radio waves to detect objects based on reflection, providing a safer alternative with the ability to identify metallic and non-metallic items without revealing personal details. Both types play critical roles in security screening contexts.</p></p>
