<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polygalacturonase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endo Polygalacturonase</li><li>Exo Polygalacturonase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polygalacturonase market is categorized into two main types: endo-polygalacturonase and exo-polygalacturonase. Endo-polygalacturonase acts on the internal bonds of pectin, facilitating the breakdown of fruit and vegetable cell walls, which is beneficial in food processing, juice extraction, and textile industries. In contrast, exo-polygalacturonase cleaves pectin from the ends of the polysaccharide chains, enhancing processes like fruit ripening and improving texture in food products. Both types play crucial roles in agricultural, food, and beverage applications.</p></p>
