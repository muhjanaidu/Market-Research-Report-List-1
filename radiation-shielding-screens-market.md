<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Shielding Screens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-Ray</li><li>Gamma Ray</li><li>Beta Ray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation shielding screens are designed to protect against different types of radiation, including X-rays, gamma rays, and beta rays. X-ray shields often use lead due to its high density, making it effective for medical imaging environments. Gamma ray shielding requires heavier materials like tungsten or concrete, as gamma rays penetrate more deeply. Beta ray shielding typically involves lighter materials like plastic or glass, as beta particles are less penetrating and can be effectively stopped by these substances. Each type is tailored to specific radiation protection needs.</p></p>
